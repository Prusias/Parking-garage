### **Parking garage simulation**

Made for Hanze University of applied sciences as the execution of a project
about refactoring and extending a existing parking garage simulation in Java. 
This project was made in 3 weeks but the majority of the work was done in the last week.

The details of this project are found in the "Project_Parkeergarage 2017.pdf".
This pdf is in Dutch so we will list the requirements in short:

* Add a reservation system
* Reserve parking spots for people with a subscription
* Add multiple queues, both for subscription holders, regular vehicles and the exits.
* Add a way to set the business of a given day and/or hour
* If the queue for the garage is to long cars will drive past
* Add a simple GUI to run the simulation in steps
* Show the profit made

There were also some bonus objectives we implemented:

* Make the simulation event driven
* Add parking spots for electric vehicles and let them come into the garage
* Add the possibility to change the amount of queues
* Add the ability to adjust the size of the garage
* Show a prediction of the profit made if all cars currently in the garage left

We also implemented some of our own bonus objectives.

* Added motorcycles and motorcycle parking spots
* Make the simulation highly configurable through a settings menu
* Add a seed for the simulation
* Make parking realistic with a weight system for parking spots
* Make the generation of cars and their stay duration realistic.
* Add the ability to pause the simulation
* Add several graphs to view data about the simulation
