### **Parking garage simulation**

Made for Hanze University of Applied Sciences as a collaborative assignment about refactoring and extending an existing parking garage simulation in Java. This project was made in the first year of my studies, in about 3 weeks.

The details of this project are found in the (Dutch) PDF [Project_Parkeergarage 2017.pdf](https://github.com/Prusias/Parking-garage/blob/master/Project_Parkeergarage%202017.pdf). 

A short summary of the requirements as outlined in the document is as follows:

* Add a reservation system
* Reserve parking spots for people with a subscription
* Add multiple queues, both for subscription holders, regular vehicles and the exits.
* Add a way to set the business of a given day and/or hour
* If the queue for the garage is too long, cars will drive past
* Add a simple GUI to run the simulation in steps
* Show the profit made

There were also some bonus objectives implemented:

* Make the simulation event driven
* Add parking spots for electric vehicles and let them come into the garage
* Add the possibility to change the amount of queues
* Add the ability to adjust the size of the garage
* Show a prediction of the profit made if all cars currently in the garage left

As well as some extra features not outlined in the document:

* Added motorcycles and motorcycle parking spots
* Make the simulation highly configurable through a settings menu
* Add a seed for the simulation
* Make parking realistic with a weight system for parking spots
* Make the generation of cars and their stay duration realistic.
* Add the ability to pause the simulation
* Add several graphs to view data about the simulation
